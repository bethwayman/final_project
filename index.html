                <h2>Beth Wayman</h2>
                <p>I was born in The Crimea (Ukraine). I was adopted 
                    by the most amazing family in 2002, along with three 
                    other boys. Since that time I have been searching to 
                    find my place in this world. Growing up I was extreamly 
                    creative and athletic. I loved sewing, painting, playing 
                    outside with my brothers. I also signed up for all the sports, 
                    volleyball, basketball, tennis, cross country, and track and field. 
                    However, nothing captured my heart quite like softball did. 
                    I spent 12 years dedicating my mind, body and heart to the one thing that 
                    I loved the most. Softball not only taught me dedication, 
                    but also leadership, teamwork, time management, and perseverence. 
                    I devoted countless hours to be the best player I could be. 
                    However, graduation came too soon and it was time to focus 
                    on other priorities. I have worked several jobs over the years 
                    trying to find something that would speak to me the way softball 
                    had all those years. Nothing seemed to inspire me. It wasn't until 
                    after I had my son that i realized i need to find a new passion that 
                    would challenge me daily and spark my creativity. I started dedicating all
                    my free time to learing web development. All of the sudden I feel the excitment 
                    that i felt all those years of playing softball come rushing back. I had found my new passion.
                    and with the same determination, creatiity, and persistance, I know that I can persevere.
